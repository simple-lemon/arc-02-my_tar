# Welcome to My Tar
***

## Task
After deleting the extra stuff from git, I couldn't upload it to git, so we reopened the project.
## Description
The option I had the most trouble with was the xf option and I had to open the tar file twice.

## Installation
We uploaded the project via git.

## Usage
This project took me too long and the 2 options I struggled with the most were xf and uf.
You didn't use npm. Since this is not a big project, it is not necessary to use it in practice.
